/**
 *  Stochastic oxygen-based cell cycle model
 *
 *  A simple oxygen-dependent cell cycle model that inherits from
 *  AbstractSimpleCellCycleModel. The duration of G1 phase depends
 *  on the local oxygen concentration. A prolonged period of acute
 *  hypoxia leads to the cell being labelled as apoptotic. This model
 *  allows for quiescence imposed by transient periods of hypoxia,
 *  followed by reoxygenation.
