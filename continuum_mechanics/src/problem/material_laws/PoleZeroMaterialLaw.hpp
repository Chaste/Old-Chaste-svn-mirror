/**
 *  Pole-zero material law
 *
 *  NOTE: CHANGED THE CODE AT THE MOMENT TO NOT USE THE POSITIVE PART BIT BELOW
 *  AS THEN IT IS NOT TWICE DIFFERENTIABLE
 *
 *  W = Sum_{M,N=1..3} k_{MN} ([ E_{MN} ]_+)^2 / (a_{MN} - E_{MN})^b_{MN}
 *
 *  Note the positive part operator in the numerator, so that
 *  the term in W corresponding to M,N is zero if E_MN < 0. (This differs
 *  from the original pole-zero paper but seems to be what they meant..)
 *
 *  Note that is the parameters k4,k5,k6,a4,a5,a6 etc are known, then
 *  k01=k10=0.5*k4 and similarly with k5,k6, but a01=a10=a4 etc.
 *
 *  Not isotropic, so inherits directly from AbstractIncompressibleMaterialLaw
 *
 *  Note, by default, the fibre direction is assumed to be THE X-DIRECTION,
 *  and the sheet direction the Y-DIRECTION (ie sheets in the XY plane). Call
 *  SetChangeOfBasisMatrix() before ComputeStressAndStressDerivative(), with
 *  the matrix P = [fibre_vec, sheet_vec, normal_vec] if this is not the case.
