/**
 * An ODE system formed by combining several subsystems.
 * 
 * Instances of this class are formed by passing other ODE system instances
 * to our constructor, and then calling Configure to set up any coupling
 * between subsystems.  This allows state variables from one system to be
 * used as parameters in other systems.
 * 
 * This allows us to set up coupled systems such as
 *   \f$dy/dt = f(y, t)\f$
 * from subsystems
 *   \f$dy_1/dt = f_1(y_1, t; y_2)\f$
 * and
 *   \f$dy_2/dt = f_2(y_2, t; y_1)\f$
 * where
 *   \f$y = (y_1, y_2)\f$.
 * 
 * The vector of state variables for the combined system is formed as the
 * concatenation of the state variable vectors of the subsystem.  This
 * class also makes use of the CombinedOdeSystemInformation class to
 * provide initial conditions, etc.
