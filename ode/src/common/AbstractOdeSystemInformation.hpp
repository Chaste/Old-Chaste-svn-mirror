/**
 * An abstract class which provides access to information about a particular
 * ODE system *class* (as opposed to an instance).
 *
 * The information available includes:
 *  - names of state variables
 *  - units of state variables
 *  - suggested initial conditions
 *  - names of (settable) parameters
 *  - units of (settable) parameters
 *  - names of derived quantities
 *  - units of derived quantities
 *
 * This class requires a subclass defining the Initialise method in order to set
 * up the information.  Developers may do this by defining their own subclass, but
 * the most convenient method is likely to be to use the OdeSystemInformation
 * class, which is a templated singleton subclass of this AbstractOdeSystemInformation
 * class.  See its documentation for details of how to use it.
