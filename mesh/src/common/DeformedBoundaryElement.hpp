/**
 *  The mechanics solvers in some cases require performing integration over
 *  deformed surfaces, for which this class is a helper class. It takes in
 *  an base boundary element, and a set of displacements for each node of the mesh,
 *  and sets up the corresponding deformed boundary element, on which
 *  CalculateNormal(), ComputeJacobianDeterminant() etc can be called.
 *
 *  Note: just use the vertices of the elements, ignores internal nodes, hence this
 *  class is treats the element as a linear element (ie ignores the possible curved
 *  deformed edges). Hence the outward normal, jacobian determinant etc is constant
 *  across the element.
