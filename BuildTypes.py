# Chaste Build System Scripts

# This module is designed to be imported by both the build scripts and the
# web interface to test results. Given a name representing a build type
# (a valid value of the build argument to scons) it determines what compile
# tools & flags to use, and also how to interpret the status string of a test
# suite.
