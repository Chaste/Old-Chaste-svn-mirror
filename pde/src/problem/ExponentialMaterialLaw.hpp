/**
 *  ExponentialMaterialLaw
 *
 *  An exponential isotropic incompressible hyperelastic material law for finite
 *  elasticity
 *
 *  The law is given by a strain energy function
 *      W(I_1,I_2,I_3) = a exp( b(I_1-3) ) - p/2 C^{-1}
 *  in 3d, or
 *      W(I_1,I_2,I_3) = a exp( b(I_1-2) ) - p/2 C^{-1}
 *  in 2d.
 *
 *  Here I_i are the principal invariants of C, the Lagrangian deformation tensor.
 *  (I1=trace(C), I2=trace(C)^2-trace(C^2), I3=det(C)).

 *  Note: only dimension equals 2 or 3 is permitted.
