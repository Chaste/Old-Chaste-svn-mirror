/**
 *   An assembler for assembling surface element contributions to a vector coming from
 *   Neumann boundary conditions, assuming the prescribed BCs are NATURAL boundary conditions.
 *
 *   Examples of natural BCs:
 *   u_t = u_{xx} +f                ---> natural BCs are specification of (u_x \cdot n) = g
 *   u_t = Laplacian(u) +f          ---> natural BCs are specification of (grad(u) \cdot n) = g
 *   u_t = Div (D grad(u))          ---> natural BCs are specification of ( (D grad(u)) \cdot n) = g
 *   0   = Div (D grad(u))          ---> natural BCs are specification of ( (D grad(u)) \cdot n) = g
 *   0   = Div (D1 grad(u1)) + Div (D2 grad(u2)) (one equation of a 2-unknown problem)
 *        ---> natural BCs are specification of ( (D1 grad(u1)) \cdot n + (D2 grad(u2)) \cdot n) = g1
 *
 *   In all cases, when in weak form, the surface integral is integral(gv dS), where v is the test function
 *   (or integral_over_Gamma(g1*v1+g2*v2 dS) in the 2-unknown case).
 *
 *   The contribution of the finite element vector is therefore always: the STRIPED version of the following
 *   BLOCK vector: [c1 c2 .. cP], where P = PROBLEM_DIM, each c_i is of dimension N (number of nodes/bases), and
 *   c1 has entries `integral_over_Gamma (g1*phi_i dS)`, etc.
