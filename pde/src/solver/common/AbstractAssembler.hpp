/**
 *  AbstractAssembler
 *
 *  Base class from which all solvers for linear and nonlinear PDEs inherit.
 *  Templated over the PROBLEM_DIM so also handles problems with more than one
 *  unknown variable (ie those of the form u_xx + v = 0, v_xx + 2u = 1, where
 *  PROBLEM_DIM is equal to 2)
 *
 *  It defines a common interface for AssembleSystem,
 *  AssembleOnElement and AssembleOnSurfaceElement. Each of these work
 *  for any PROBLEM_DIM>=1. Each of these methods work in both the
 *  dynamic case (when there is a current solution available) and the static
 *  case. The same code is used for the nonlinear and linear cases. Default
 *  code is defined in AbstractStaticAssembler
 *
 *  user calls:
 *
 *  Solve(). In the linear case Solve() calls AssembleSystem() directly, in the
 *  nonlinear case Solve() calls the PETSc nonlinear
 *  solver which then calls AssembleResidual or AssembleJacobian, both of which
 *  call AssembleSystem():
 *
 *  AssembleSystem(). (implemented in AbstractStaticAssembler, loops over elements
 *  and adds to the linear system or residual vector or jacobian matrix)
 *  AssembleSystem() calls:
 *
 *  AssembleOnElement() and AssembleOnSurfaceElement(). (implemented in
 *  AbstractStaticAssembler. These loop over gauss points and create the
 *  element stiffness matrix and vector in the linear case ). They call:
 *
 *  ComputeMatrixTerm(), ComputeVectorTerm(), ComputeVectorSurfaceTerm() (implemented in
 *  the concrete assembler class (eg SimpleDg0ParabolicAssembler), which tells
 *  this assembler exactly what function of bases, position, pde constants etc
 *  to add to the element stiffness matrix/vector).
