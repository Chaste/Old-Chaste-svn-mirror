/**
 *  A class for setting up the boundary conditions associated with electrodes.
 *  There are two modes: grounding the second electrode, in which case the first
 *  electrode has an input flux (Neumann boundary condition) of the specified
 *  magnitude, the extracellular potential is fixed on the second electrode; or
 *  not grounded, in which case the opposite electrode has an equal and opposite
 *  output flux.
 *
 *  This class assumes the given mesh is cuboid, and the electrodes are taken to be
 *  the specified opposite surfaces.
 *
 *  Note the class now includes a pointer to the mesh as a member variable, as this
 *  is required to archive (reconstruct) itself. Because boost is clever it will
 *  still only archive one copy of the mesh.
