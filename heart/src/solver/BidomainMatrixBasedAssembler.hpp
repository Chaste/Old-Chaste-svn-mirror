 *  BidomainRhsMatrixAssembler

 *  This class only exists to construct a matrix, the matrix which is used
 *  to assemble the RHS in monodomain problems. Therefore, although it inherits
 *  from the assembler hierachy, it is not an assembler for any particular
 *  PDE problem, it is just used to assemble one matrix. Therefore only
 *  ConstructMatrixTerm is properly implemented.
 *
 *  The matrix that is constructed is in fact the mass matrix for a 2-unknown problem.
 *  ie ***IF*** the unknowns were ordered [V1 V2 .. V_N phi_e1 ... phi_eN ], the matrix would
 *  be
 *  [M 0]
 *  [0 M]
 *  where
 *  M_ij = integral phi_i phi_j dV, where phi_k is the k-th basis function
