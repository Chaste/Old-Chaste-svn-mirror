/**
 *  Assembler, mainly used for assembling the LHS matrix of the linear system
 *  that arises when the monodomain equations are discretised.
 * 
 *  The discretised monodomain equation leads to the linear system (see FEM 
 *  implementations document)
 * 
 *  ( (chi*C/dt) M  + K ) V^{n+1} = (chi*C/dt) M V^{n} + M F^{n} + c_surf  
 *
 *  where chi is the surface-area to volume ratio, C the capacitance, dt the timestep
 *  M the mass matrix, K the stiffness matrix, V^{n} the vector of voltages at time n,
 *  F^{n} the vector of (chi*Iionic + Istim) at each node, and c_surf a vector
 *  arising from any surface stimuli (usually zero).
 * 
 *  This assembler is used for assembling the matrix A :=(chi*C/dt) M  + K.
 *  Hence, this class inherits from AbstractCardiacFeVolumeIntegralAssembler and implements the 
 *  method ComputeMatrixTerm().
