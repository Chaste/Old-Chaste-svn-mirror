 *  to assemble the RHS in monodomain problems. Therefore, although it inherits
 *  from the assembler hierachy, it is not an assembler for any particular
 *  PDE problem, it is just used to assemble one matrix. Therefore only
 *  ConstructMatrixTerm is properly implemented.
 *
 *  The matrix that is constructed is in fact the mass matrix:
 *  A_ij = integral phi_i phi_j dV, where phi_k is the k-th basis function
