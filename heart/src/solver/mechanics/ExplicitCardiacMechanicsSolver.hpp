/**
 *  Explicit cardiac mechanics solver for solving electromechanic problems where the
 *  contraction model is not stretch-rate-dependent (for those the implicit solver is
 *  needed).
 *
 *  The first template parameter should be either NonlinearElasticitySolver
 *  or CompressibleNonlinearElasticityAssembler; this will be the class that this class
 *  ultimately inherits from.
 *
 *  The general explicit solution procedure is to do, each timestep:
 *  (0) [solve the electrics and interpolate Ca and voltage onto quad points
 *  (i) pass Ca and voltage to the contraction models
 *  (ii) pass the fibre stretch to the contraction models in case this is needed.
 *  (iii) integrate the contraction models in order to get the active tension
 *  (iv) solve for the deformation using this active tension.
