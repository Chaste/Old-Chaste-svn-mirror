/**
 *  NHS system with build in implicit solver. Jon Whiteley's method, which breaks down
 *  the multivariable implicit solve into a sequence of 1d implicit solves.
 *
 *  The idea is to solve a 1d nonlinear problem for the active tension, where the problem
 *  f(T_a)=T_a, where T_a is the current active tension, and f(T_a) is the active tension
 *  obtained by assuming this active tension and solving the ODEs as follows:
 *
 *  Given T_a, so compute solution for Ca_trop using backward euler (1d linear problem)
 *  Using this Ca_trop, compute solution for z using backward euler (1d nonlinear problem)
 *  Solve for Qi implicitly using backward euler (three 1d linear problems)
 *  Compute T0, Q and then T_a
 *
