 * in computing its right-hand side, it calls calc() with the current value and uses
 * the result of that instead.
 * 
 * Clearly for this to work the cell model must be modified to include calls to instances
 * of these classes.  PyCml has some experimental support for this, generating subclasses
 * of AbstractCardiacCellWithModifiers.
