/**
 * Concrete implementation of AbstractOdeSystemInformation designed for use where
 * some of the system information *can* vary across instances.  As with
 * OdeSystemInformation it is templated by ODE system class, to aid developers of
 * ODE system classes - only a specialisation of the Initialise method is required.
 * 
 * Note: unexpected behaviour can occur if ODE system objects are copied
 * (via copy constructor or operator=).  The AbstractOdeSystem maintains a smart
 * pointer (boost::shared_ptr) to the system information object.  Hence both the
 * original and the copy will share the same information object.
