 * Base class for cell mutation states.
 *
 * Each TissueCell has a (shared pointer to a) mutation state instance, which will
 * be an instance of a subclass of this class.  When setting up a TissueSimulation,
 * the user must specify a list of AbstractCellMutationState instances, which represent
 * the possible mutations that can occur in the simulation (including WildTypeCellMutationState).
 * This provides a registry of available mutation states, and cells will point to
 * one of these objects.
 *
 * The mutation state objects keep track of the number of cells in a given mutation
 * state, as well as what colour should be used by the visualizer to display cells
 * in each state.
