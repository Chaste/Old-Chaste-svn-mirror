/**
 * Stochastic oxygen-based cell cycle model
 *
 * A simple oxygen-dependent cell cycle model that inherits from
 * AbstractSimpleCellCycleModel. The duration of G1 phase depends
 * on the local oxygen concentration. A prolonged period of acute
 * hypoxia leads to the cell being labelled as apoptotic. This model
 * allows for quiescence imposed by transient periods of hypoxia,
 * followed by reoxygenation.
 * 
 * \todo make a subclass of SimpleOxygenBasedCellCycleModel to avoid
 * code duplication (#1508)
