/**
 * An update rule class to model uniform steady advection. This class is
 * currently implemented in 2D only.
 *
 * The constructor must be passed an unsigned that corresponds to one of
 * the eight possible flow directions in 2D (N, NW, W,SW, S, SE, E, NE)
 * and a double that gives the speed of the flow. At each time step, a
 * uniform random number r_i is generated for each cell i that has a free
 * neighbour in the direction of the imposed flow; if r_i < s*dt, where
 * s denotes the flow speed and dt denotes the time step, then the cell is
 * moved. This ensures that the mean speed of an advected cell is equal to
 * the flow speed, independent of the time step used.
