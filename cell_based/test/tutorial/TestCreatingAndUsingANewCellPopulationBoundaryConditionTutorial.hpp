 * As an example, let us consider a boundary condition for a two-dimensional cell-based
 * simulation, in which all cells are constrained to lie within the domain given in
 * Cartesian coordinates by 0 <= y <= 5. To implement this we define a cell population
 * boundary condition class, {{{MyBoundaryCondition}}}, which inherits from
