 * == Introduction ==
 *
 * In the crypt tutorial, we used an existing cell killer class to define
 * how cells were sloughed off the top of a crypt. In this tutorial we show
 * how to create a new cell killer class, and how this can be used in a cell-based
 * simulation.
 *
 * == 1. Including header files ==
 *
 * As in previous cell-based Chaste tutorials, we begin by including the necessary
 * header file and archiving headers.
