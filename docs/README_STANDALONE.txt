Welcome to Chaste.

This README file is for the Chaste standalone cardiac simulation
executable.  The source release of Chaste can be obtained from
http://web.comlab.ox.ac.uk/chaste/.

SUMMARY:
========

 * INSTALLATION
 * RUNNING AN EXAMPLE
 * RUNNING IN PARALLEL
 * KNOWN ISSUES
 

INSTALLATION:
=============

Select a suitable directory where to place the files and cd into it.
Unpack the downloaded compressed executable.
For an XX bits machine and release name YYYY, type

tar xvfz StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit.tgz

There are 12 items:
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/README.txt (this file)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/Chaste	(the executable file)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/Chaste.sh (A wrapper for running the executable Chaste with the correct libraries)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/ChasteParameters.xml (where to specify all the parameters for a simulation e.g., mesh, cell models, output directory etc.)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/ChasteParametersFullFormat.xml (fully documented xml file showing all available options)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/ChasteParametersResumeSimulationFullFormat.xml (fully documented xml file showing resume options)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/ChasteParameters_2_1.xsd (xml schema. Please, do not edit this file)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/ChasteParameters_2_0.xsd (xml schema for previous release. Please, do not edit this file)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/ChasteParameters_1_1.xsd (xml schema for previous release. Please, do not edit this file)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/archive_convert.sed (A utility for converting a Chaste 2.0 archive into a Chaste 2.1 archive)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/docs (Documentation folder)
StandaloneChaste_YYYY_XXbit/libs (Libraries folder)


RUNNING AN EXAMPLE:
===================

In order to run a simulation edit the ChasteParameters.xml file
according to your needs and, from the installation directory, type

./Chaste.sh ChasteParameters.xml

Please note that the output directory specified in the
ChasteParameters.xml file is relative to a directory defined by the
environmental variable CHASTE_TEST_OUTPUT.  In order to set the
CHASTE_TEST_OUTPUT to a desired location:

export CHASTE_TEST_OUTPUT=Desired_Directory_Path

If CHASTE_TEST_OUTPUT is not set, results will be found relative to a
'testoutput' folder in the current directory.

If you are familiar with XML and you are unsure of the types of
changes which you are permitted to make to the ChasteParameters.xml
file, then please see the ChasteParameters.xsd schema file.  For
example, the schema contains a selection of cell models:
<xs:simpleType name="ionic_model_type">
    <xs:restriction base="xs:string">
      <xs:enumeration value="BackwardEulerFoxModel2002Modified"/>
      <xs:enumeration value="BackwardEulerLuoRudyIModel1991"/>
      <xs:enumeration value="LuoRudyIModel1991OdeSystem"/>
etc...


RUNNING IN PARALLEL:
====================

If you have multiple cores available in your machine, you can reduce
execution time of your simulation by distributing the computational load
among multiple cores. To run the executable on (for example) 2 cores, type

./Chaste.sh -np 2 ChasteParameters.xml

you may run the executable on as many processors as you wish by changing
this number. Bear in mind that the more processors that are used
means a greater communication overhead between them.  If you have ten 
processors and ten simulations to run, then it may be better to run 
all at once with "-np 1", rather than each in turn with "-np 10".

Note that the executables we distribute are prepared to run only in SMP/multicore
architectures. If you want to run Chaste in a cluster, you will need to
download and build from source code.
