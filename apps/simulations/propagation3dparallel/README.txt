This mesh is a downsampled version of the Oxford rabbit cardiac model: Bishop et al. Martin J. Bishop, Gernot Plank, Rebecca A. B. Burton, JÃ¼rgen E. Schneider, David J. Gavaghan, Vicente Grau, and Peter Kohl "Development of an anatomically detailed MRI-derived rabbit ventricular model and assessment of its impact on simulations of electrophysiological function" (Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol, 2010)
The full-resolution mesh has been released as Open Source data and is available to download from www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/chaste

We would like to ask any user:
	- not to re-distribute the mesh, but point any potential user to www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/chaste for our own tracking purposes.
	- acknowledge source if used for presentation / publication. For details contact chaste-users@maillist.ox.ac.uk
