The full-resolution mesh has been released as Open Source data and is available to download from www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste. The full resolution mesh
has an average edge-length of 125 microns, this mesh has an average edge length of 482 microns.

We would like to ask any user:
	- not to re-distribute the mesh, but point any potential user to www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste for our own tracking purposes.
	- acknowledge source if used for presentation / publication. For details contact chaste-users@maillist.ox.ac.uk
