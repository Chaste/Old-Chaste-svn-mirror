"Cancer, Heart and Soft Tissue Environment (Chaste)". 
This Library is a package of code written primarily in C++ and developed primarily 
for modelling cardiac function and tumour growth. The Library includes core modules
for parallel setup and error handling (global), for data input and output (io), for
interfacing PETSc linear algrebra routines (linalg), for triangular and tetrahedral
mesh functionality (mesh), for solving ordinary differential equations (ode) and for
solving partial differential equations using the finite element method (pde). 
The main application modules for cancer, heart and mechanics are built using the 
functionality of the core modules and use state-of-the-art numerical techniques and
cell models. 

University means the Chancellor, Masters and Scholars of the University of Oxford, 
having an administrative office at Wellington Square, Oxford OX1 2JD, UK.
