(Files Generated by TestMutationSpread.hpp) 

These four mpeg files follow the progeny of a single cell, 
labelled using the archives in the folder:

'CellProliferation09/test/data/SteadyStateSimpleWnt/sunter3_archive',

Archives are from t=300 (in a quasi-steady state).
Each simulation is identical in behaviour with a different cell labelled.

overall_results.dat
-- shows how the different cell populations
reduce down to a monoclonal crypt over time (1400 hours or over 8 weeks)

The mpeg files:
simulation_141.mpeg
simulation_274.mpeg
simulation_282.mpeg
simulation_353.mpeg
-- are numbered with the ancestor cell that they track.
