 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * This tutorial assumes you have already read UserTutorials/RunningMeshBasedCryptSimulations
 * and UserTutorials/RunningVertexBasedCryptSimulations.
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * In this tutorial we show how Chaste can be used to simulate a cylindrical model of an
 * intestinal crypt with mutations in both mesh and vertex based simulations.
 * Full details of the computational model can be found in the paper by
 * Osborne ''et al.'' (2010) [10.1098/rsta.2010.0173].
 *
 * The first thing to do is include the following header file, which allows us
 * to use certain methods in our test. This header file must be included
 * in any Chaste test.
 */

/*
 * Any test in which the {{{GetIdentifier()}}} method is used, even via the main
 * `cell_based` code (through calls to {{{AbstractCellPopulation}}} output methods),
 * must also include {{{CheckpointArchiveTypes.hpp}}} or {{{CellBasedSimulationArchiver.hpp}}}
 * as the first Chaste header file.

 * The next two header files define two different types of cell-cycle model.
 * In a {{{FixedDurationGenerationBasedCellCycleModel}}}, the duration of each phase
 * of the cell cycle is fixed. In a {{{WntCellCycleModel}}}, the duration of a cell's G1 phase
 * is determined by a system of nonlinear ODEs describing a cell's response to the local
 * concentration of Wnt,
 * a secreted cellâ€“cell signalling molecule that is known to play a key role in cell
 * proliferation in the crypt. In our crypt simulations, we impose a fixed gradient of
 * Wnt up the axis of the crypt.

 * to cells; instead they help ensure that a sensible Delaunay triangulation is generated
 * at each timestep. This is because the triangulation algorithm requires a convex hull. */
