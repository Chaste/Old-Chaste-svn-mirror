 * In this tutorial we show how Chaste can be used to simulate a cylindrical model of an
 * intestinal crypt with mutations in both mesh and vertex-based simulations.
 * Full details of the computational model can be found in the paper by
 * Osborne ''et al.'' (2010) [10.1098/rsta.2010.0173].
 *
 * As in previous cell-based Chaste tutorials, we begin by including the necessary header files.
