     * This test is required because Test2DCryptRepresentativeSimulation loads
     * an archive stored in crypt/test/data. When the archiving of
     * CellBasedSimulation and associate classes is updated, the stored archive
     * needs to be updated. This test checks that the archive can be loaded,
     * and will seg fault if not. It does nothing more, so it runs quickly
     * and can be in the continuous test pack.
     *
     * IF THIS TEST FAILS:
     * - You have probably changed an archiving method somewhere
     * - You need to remake crypt/test/data/<test below>/archive/
     * - To do this re-run TestGenerateSteadyStateCrypt.hpp
     * - Archives produced can then be copied to crypt/test/data/<test below>/archive/
     *
     * Note that when updating the archive, you can run TestGenerateSteadyStateCrypt.hpp
     * with build=GccOpt to speed up the test.
     *
     * NB: Produce archives with
       scons build=GccOpt_hostconfig,boost=1-33-1,use-cvode=0 test_suite=crypt/test/simulation/TestGenerateSteadyStateCrypt.hpp
