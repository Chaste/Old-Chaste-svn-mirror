/**
 *  A singleton log file class. Allows the user to define log file in the test, which
 *  can be written to (without being passed around in the code).
 *
 *  Usage (in test):
 *
 *  // begining of test
 *  LogFile* p_log = LogFile::Instance();
 *  p_log->Set(level, "dir","file");
 *  p_log->WriteHeader("type_of_sim"); // optional
 *
 *  // at end of simulation
 *  LogFile::Close();
 *
 *  Here 'level' is a number between 0 and LogFile::MaxLoggingLevel, with zero
 *  meaning no logging and MaxLoggingLevel meaning full logging.
 *
 *  Usage (in source) - use the macro 'LOG'
 *  LOG(1, "Info to be written to the log file\n" << "More info\n");
 *  LogFile::Instance()->WriteElapsedTime(); // optional
 *
 *  This checks whether the given level (here '1') is greater or equal to the given
 *  logging level, in which case it writes to the current log file. If there is
 *  no log file is set up it does nothing.
 *
 *  Note the log file can be written to directly, without any level-checking, using
 *  (*LogFile::Instance()) << "Info to be written to the log file\n";
