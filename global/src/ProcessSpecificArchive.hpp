/**
 * When checkpointing a parallel simulation, there are two kinds of data that need to be saved:
 * replicated (same for every process) and distributed (different on each process).  We wish to
 * write these to separate locations, so that the replicated data is only written to disk once,
 * and to make it easier to re-load on a different number of processes (in which case the
 * distributed data will need to be re-distributed).  However, the Boost Serialization library
 * expects to be writing to just one archive.
 * 
 * This class provides access to a secondary archive in which to store the distributed data.
 * When opening an archive in a (potentially) parallel setting, using either the ArchiveOpener
 * or CardiacSimulationArchiver, the Set method will be called to specify the archive.  Classes
 * which need to save distributed data can then use the Get method to access and write to/read
 * from this archive.
 * 
 * Note that because this class stores just a pointer to the archive, whatever object owns the
 * archive must ensure it exists for the duration of the serialization process, and call
 * Set(NULL) prior to closing the archive for safety.
 * 
 * Note also that implementations of this templated class only exist for text archives, i.e.
 * Archive = boost::archive::text_iarchive or Archive = boost::archive::text_oarchive.
