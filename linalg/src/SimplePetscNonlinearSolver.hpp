/**
 * Simple Nonlinear PDE system solver, uses the PETSc SNES Solver, which uses Newton's method.
 *
 * @param pComputeResidual points to the function which
 * computes the residual, it must take arguments SNES (a PETSc nonlinear solver
 * object), Vec (current guess - a vector of the correct size), Vec (a Vec of the
 * correct size in which the residual is returned), void* (a pointer to
 * anything you may need to refer to when calculating the residual)
 *
 * @param pComputeJacobian points to
 * the function which computes the Jacobian, it must take arguments SNES (a PETSc
 * nonlinear solver * object), Mat* (a pointer to the Jacobian matrix) ,Mat* (a pointer
 * to a preconditioner matrix), MatStructure* (points to the PETSc matrix type e.g. AIJ), void* (a pointer to
 * anything you may need to refer to when calculating the residual).
 *
 * @param initialGuess A PETSc Vec of the correct size, containing initial guesses
 *  for the nonlinear solver.
 *
 * @param pContext [optional] A pointer to a class that may have to be used in the
 *  ComputeResidual and ComputeJacobian functions
 *
 * @param fill the expected maximum number of nonzeros in a row of the Jacobian matrix

 *
 * @return Returns a PETSc Vec of the solution.
 *
 * To be used in the form:
 * Vec answer=solver->Solve(&ComputeResidual, &ComputeJacobian, initialGuess, NULL);
 *
 * In the same file, but outside this class the functions ComputeResidual and
 * ComputeJacobian must sit, using the input arguments specified above.
