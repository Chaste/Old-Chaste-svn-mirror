/**
 *  This class defines a PETSc-compliant purpouse-build preconditioner.
 *
 *  Let A be a matrix arising in the FEM discretisation of the bidomain equations with the following block structure:
 *
 *                 A = (A11  B')
 *                     (B   A22)
 *
 *  By creating an instance of this class, one will define the following preconditioner:
 *
 *                 inv(M) = inv( (A11   0)   = (inv(A11)        0)
 *                               (0   A22) )   (0        inv(A22))
 *
 *  The inverses are approximate with one cycle of AMG.
 *
 *  Note: This class requires PETSc to be build including HYPRE library. If it's not available, it will throw the following error:
 *
 *     [0]PETSC ERROR: --------------------- Error Message ------------------------------------
 *     [0]PETSC ERROR: Unknown type. Check for miss-spelling or missing external package needed for type!
 *     [0]PETSC ERROR: Unable to find requested PC type hypre!
 *
 *        and will approximate the inverse of the subblocks with PETSc's default preconditioner (bjacobi at the time of writing this).
