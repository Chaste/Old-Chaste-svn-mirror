     * is
     *
     * x_new = x_old - J^{-1} f
     *
     * where J is the Jacobian matrix evaluated at x_old and f the residual evaluated at
     * x_old. The Newton method with damping is
     *
     * x_new = x_old - s J^{-1} f
     *
     * where s is some damping factor. Here s is chosen by just looked at a fixed set of
     * possible damping factors and choosing the one which gives the best x_new (the one
     * for which the residual evaluated at x_new has the lowest norm).
     *
     * The solver quits once the ||f||/numVariables
     *
     * @param pComputeResidual points to the function which
     * computes the residual, it must take arguments SNES (a PETSc nonlinear solver
     * object), Vec (current guess - a vector of the correct size), Vec (a Vec of the
     * correct size in which the residual is returned), void* (a pointer to
     * anything you may need to refer to when calculating the residual)
     *
     * @param pComputeJacobian points to
     * the function which computes the Jacobian, it must take arguments SNES (a PETSc
     * nonlinear solver * object), Mat* (a pointer to the Jacobian matrix) ,Mat* (a pointer
     * to a preconditioner matrix), MatStructure* (points to the PETSc matrix type e.g. AIJ), void* (a pointer to
     * anything you may need to refer to when calculating the residual).
     *
     * @param initialGuess A PETSc Vec of the correct size, containing initial guesses
     * for the nonlinear solver.
     *
     * @param pContext [optional] A pointer to a class that may have to be used in the
     *  ComputeResidual and ComputeJacobian functions
     *
     * @return Returns a PETSc Vec of the solution.
     *
     * To be used in the form:
     * Vec answer=solver->Solve(&ComputeResidual, &ComputeJacobian, initialGuess, NULL);
