/**
 *  This class defines a PETSc-compliant purpose-built preconditioner.
 *
 *  Let A be a matrix arising in the FEM discretisation of the bidomain equations with the following block structure:
 *
 *                 A = (A11  B')
 *                     (B  A22)
 *
 *  Let A=LDU be the following matrix factorisation
 *
 *                 LDU = (I      0)(A11 0)(I inv(A11)B')
 *                       (B*A11' I)(0  S)(0          I)
 *
 *  with I the identity matrix and S=A22-B*inv(A11)*B'
 *
 *  Let inv(A) be a preconditioner
 *
 *                 inv(A) = inv(U)inv(D)inv(L) = (I -inv(A11)B')(inv(A11)      0)(I           0)
 *                                               (0           I)(0       inv(S))(-B*inv(A11) I)
 *
 *  This class implements an approximation of inv(A) where S=A22
 *
 *                 inv(P) ~ inv(A)
 *
 *                 inv(P) = (I   -inv(A11)B')(inv(A11)         0)(I           0)
 *                          (0             I)(0       inv(S=A22))(-B*inv(A11) I)
 *
 *                 inv(P) = (inv(A11)  -inv(A11)B'inv(S=A22))(I             0)
 *                          (0                    inv(S=A22))(-B*inv(A11)   I)
 *
 *  In order to compute [y1 y2]' = inv(P)[x1 x2]' we do
 *
 *                 z  = inv(A11)*x1
 *                 y2 = inv(A22)*(x2 - B*z)
 *                 y1 = z - inv(A11)(B*y2)
 *
 *  The inverses are approximate with one cycle of AMG.
 *
 *  Note: This class requires PETSc to be build including HYPRE library. If it's not available, it will throw the following error:
 *
 *     [0]PETSC ERROR: --------------------- Error Message ------------------------------------
 *     [0]PETSC ERROR: Unknown type. Check for miss-spelling or missing external package needed for type!
 *     [0]PETSC ERROR: Unable to find requested PC type hypre!
 *
 *        and will approximate the inverse of the subblocks with PETSc's default preconditioner (bjacobi at the time of writing this).
