 * = An example showing how to run tumour spheroid simulations =
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * == Introduction ==
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * In this tutorial we show how Chaste is used to run discrete tumour
 * spheroid simulations. Like crypt simulations, tumour spheroid simulations
 * include cell cycle models and force laws to determine how cells divide and
 * move. In tumour spheroid simulations, however, these are also coupled to a
 * system of partial differential equations that determine the concentration
 * of specified nutrients (e.g. oxygen) throughout the tissue. Also, unlike
 * in crypt simulation, the tissue grows substantially as the tissue simulation
 * progresses.
 *
 * In summary, the main differences between this tutorial and the crypt simulation
 * tutorials are
 *
 *  * a PDE is defined, to be used in the simulation, and
 *  * a non-periodic mesh is used.
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * == The test ==
 *
 * EMPTYLINE
 *
 * The first thing to do is include the following header, which allows us
 * to use certain methods in our test (this header file should be included
 * in any Chaste test):
